HTTP server in Node.js
An HTTP server in Node.js is a program that listens for HTTP requests from clients (like browsers) and send back HTTP responses. Node.js provides a built-in http module to create such servers without any external libraries.
Key points:
It uses an event driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and scalable.
The server handles requests asynchronously, so it can manage many clients at the same time.
Commonly used to build web applications, REST APIs and microservices.
Basic flow:
Client sends HTTP request (URL, method, headers).
Node.js server receives the request.
Server processes it and sends an HTTP response (status code, headers, body).
Simple example:
const http = require(‘http’);
const server = http.createServer((req,re) =>{
     res.writeHead(200, { ‘Content-Type’ : ‘text/plain’ });
res.end(‘Hello, World’);
});
Server.listen(3000, ()=>{
Console.log(‘server running on port 3000’);
});
This creates an HTTP server that responds with “Hello, World” when accessed at http: //localhost: 3000.
